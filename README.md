# ML-AstroSet

Project1-Visuals.ipynb - Provides a high level overview of the data, with insights into what variables are relevant and how each stellar object is classified with the relevant attributes. 

LRandSVM.ipynb - Execution of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine classification using a linear kernal and Stochiastic Gradient Descent since the initial dataset is very large. Alternative approaches include subsampling to create a smaller representative sample of the dataset to run a SVM classification on, smaller sample was further processed with PCA. 

./data - holds the stellar dataset

./images - holds images
